# JeffBot
A discord Jeff Kaplan bot

JeffBot can respond to a variety of commands, questions, and phrases. To command him, simply send 'jeff' or 'jeffbot' followed by the command word (and target user, if any).

To run him, clone the repo and then install node.js from here: https://nodejs.org/en/. You'll also need to install some packages, first navigate to JeffBot's directory using the node.js command line (use cd C:\jeffbotdirectory) and run the following: "npm install discord.io winston --save". Then using the Git command line (you may have to install Git here: ), run the following: "npm install discord.io github:woor/discord.io#gateway_v6 winston --save" to update winston (no relation). After that, you'll need to either ask me (Cat Enigma#2898 on Discord) for the secret token to run the official JeffBot, or create your own discord bot which you can use his code under. After you have the token entered in the auth.json file, run "node jeffbot.js" from the node.js command line (make sure you're still in the project directory) and he'll (hopefully) come online.
